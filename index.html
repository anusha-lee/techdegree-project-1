        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web developer who wants to make a difference in the world. To reach my goals in my career and personal life, I decide to switch from teaching myself code to becoming a Techdegree student on Treehouse in April 2018. My goal is to become a full-time web developer in 2019.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am working in the manufacturing industry in Taiwan, and I have years of experience in this field. Other than building up my new skills in web development, I also have other soft skills like communication, self-motivation, problem-solving, and abilities to work under pressure.</p>
		<p>I've lived in China, and the U.S. for a few years and now I live in my hometown Taiwan. Other than my professional life, I enjoy reading, traveling solo and hiking.</p>

	    <h2>Personal Goals</h2>
	    <p>I enjoy outdoor activities very much. In 2017, I visited Norway to hike to Trolltunga, the most spectacular place I've visited so far. Since then, I decide to go for more long distance hikes, including, but not limited to Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Machu Picchu in Peru, and West Highland Way in Scotland.</p>
